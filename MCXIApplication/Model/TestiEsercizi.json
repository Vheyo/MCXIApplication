            "Testo": "Cristoforo Colombo was born near Genova in 1451 and ever since he was very young he was very passionate about sea and shipping. When he was 14 he became a sailor and he started travelling in different European countries. Cristoforo Colombo, also passionated by geography and astronomy, truly believe that Earth is rounded. In order to prove that to everyone, at the end of XV century he decides to travel to India shipping towards West. The expedition is very expensive so Cristoforo Colombo decides to ask an economic help to Queen Isabella of Castiglia. Once gained money and ships, he sails from Palos de la Frontera on August 3rd 1492. After months of shipping, on October 12 he lands. However, that land isn’t India but another continent: America, named at that time New World. Since them the great Spanish colonisation of the American continent starts. Cristoforo Colombo plans three more shippings for America but the several problems and major difficulties to find gold make him less loved from Spanish kings. He dies in Valladolid in 1506, poor and forgotten by everyone.",
